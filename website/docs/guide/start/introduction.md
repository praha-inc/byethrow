# Introduction

Welcome to `@praha/byethrow`, a lightweight and tree-shakable Result type library designed to handle fallible operations in JavaScript and TypeScript with elegance and simplicity.

## Features

- ðŸŒ² Tree-Shakable: Only bundle the functions you actually use. The library is designed with modern JavaScript bundlers in mind.
- ðŸ§± Lightweight & Object-Based: No classes or complex inheritance hierarchies. Just plain objects that are easy to understand and debug.
- ðŸ”„ Consistent API: All functions follow the same naming and usage patterns, making the library predictable and easy to learn.
- ðŸ”€ Unified Sync/Async Handling: Works seamlessly with both synchronous `Result<T, E>` and asynchronous `Promise<Result<T, E>>` operations.
- ðŸŽ¯ Focused Functionality: Concentrates on Result-centric utilities without unnecessary complexity or confusing variants.

## When to Use byethrow

This library is perfect for:

- **API calls** that might fail due to network issues
- **Data validation** where you need to accumulate or handle multiple errors
- **File operations** that might encounter permissions or I/O errors
- **Parser implementations** where invalid input should be handled gracefully
- **Business logic** where errors are expected and should be handled explicitly

*Happy coding with explicit error handling! ðŸŽ‰*
