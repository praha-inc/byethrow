# Why byethrow?

`@praha/byethrow` strikes a thoughtful balance in the Result type ecosystem.
While there are other excellent libraries available, byethrow offers a unique combination of features that make it stand out:

## **The Sweet Spot Between Simple and Powerful**

- **More complete than neverthrow**: While neverthrow is a great library, it occasionally lacks certain features you might need in real-world applications. Byethrow fills those gaps while maintaining simplicity.

- **Less complex than effect-ts/fp-ts**: These libraries are incredibly powerful but can introduce unnecessary complexity and overhead for many use cases. They often require a steep learning curve and extensive knowledge of functional programming concepts.

- **Better than vanilla try/catch**: Traditional error handling mixes error management with business logic, making code harder to reason about and test.

## **Designed for Real-World Use**

Byethrow was built with practical development needs in mind:

- **Team-friendly**: Easy to adopt incrementally without requiring your entire team to learn advanced functional programming
- **TypeScript-first**: Excellent type inference and safety without sacrificing developer experience
- **Performance-conscious**: Lightweight runtime with excellent tree-shaking support
- **Predictable**: Consistent API design means less cognitive overhead when switching between projects

## Why not `try/catch`?

Traditional error handling in JavaScript often leads to scattered `try/catch` blocks and unclear control flow. Result types offer several advantages:

- **Explicit Error Handling**: Errors become part of your function's return type, making them impossible to ignore
- **Composable Operations**: Chain operations together with built-in error propagation
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript can track both success and error types throughout your application
- **Cleaner Code**: Separate your business logic from error handling concerns
